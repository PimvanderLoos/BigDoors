- Executing "/listdoors" in the console without any player/doorName argument will now list all doors instead of complain about being unable to find any doors.
- Added new notification system for door creators. Thanks, @IronAR, for the suggestion! This allows door creators to opt-in on a per-door basis to receive notifications whenever a door is toggled.
- Added config option "allowNotifications" (default: true) to enable/disable the notification system.
- Added permission node "bigdoors.user.receivenotifications" that gives access to both signing up for and receiving notifications. (again, only the original creator of a door has access to this!)

- Made audio range configurable. Thanks, @OverDhill, for the suggestion!
- Whenever a chunk with active doors is unloaded, the animations will now be canceled regardless of whether or not the unload is canceled. This also goes for forceloaded chunks. Ignoring forceloaded chunks solves an issue with the server sometimes unloading forceloaded chunks regardless (looking at you, Tuinity). Thanks, @Gorderok, for the bug report!
- Tighten timing on animation cancellation.

Alpha 0.1.8.27
- Added support for version 1.16.4 of Minecraft.
- New command: "/listplayerdoors <player>". This command will list all doors owned by the given player. Permission: "bigdoors.admin.listplayerdoors".

- Made the format of log messages regarding a bit more consistent. Thanks, @SlimeDog, for the suggestion!
- Added commands: "/bigdoors disabletoggle" and "/bigdoors enabletoggle" to disable all door toggles on the server. Disabletoggle also cancels any toggles active when it is called. Permission for both: "bigdoors.admin.disabletoggle". Thanks, @SlimeDog, for the suggestion!

Alpha 0.1.8.26
- Added method to get all available doors. Thanks, @Chojo, for the implementation.
- Renamed the permission node for changing door direction to "bigdoors.user.direction" so it works with "bigdoors.user.*". Thanks, @Hydridity, for the bug report!

Alpha 0.1.8.25
- Added support for version 1.16.2 of Minecraft.
- Added support for PlotSquared v5 (in addition to v3 and v4). Thanks, @xTronix, for the bug report!

- Exposed some methods to check which chunks a door might interact with when opening and if they are currently loaded or not.
- Added new config option "loadChunksForToggle" (default: true) that determines how the plugin handles unloaded chunks. When set to true, it will load any necessary chunks and move the blocks without animation. When set to false, it will abort the toggle attempt (and not load any chunks).
- Added new config option "skipUnloadedAutoCloseToggle" (default: true) that will prevent a door being toggled in unloaded chunks if it has an autoCloseTimer set, to avoid unnecessary chunk loading. Only takes effect if "loadChunksForToggle" is enabled.
- Added new config option "maxPowerBlockDistance" (default: -1 (unlimited)) that, as the name implies, limits the maximum distance between a powerblock and the door it belongs to (its engine, specifically). Thanks, @PirateCraft, for the suggestion!
- Added new config option "maxAutoCloseTimer" (default 6000 (=5 mins)) that determines the time limit for autoCloseTimers.

Alpha 0.1.8.23
- Added full support for 1.16's new blocks so you no longer have to manually add them to the whitelist. Thanks, @thedarkonekiller, for the bug report!
- Permissions now default to OPs again.

- Renamed "bigdoors.user" permission node to "bigdoors.user.base", so that "bigdoors.user.*" will include the most important permissions as well.
- A portcullis will now respect its open direction, even if there is no space to go in that direction. Thanks, @xph11, for the bug report!

Alpha 0.1.8.22
- Abort initialization in certain invalid environments. This can be bypassed, but doing so is NOT SUPPORTED!!
- Added information about why a command failed if the plugin failed to initialize properly.
- Fixed portcullises and sliding doors getting 'stuck' when they could not find a direction to go in.
- Added configurable, global blocksToMove limit for doors such as sliding doors. This should help avoid unnecessary stress for servers caused by malicious players. Thanks, @Jim for the suggestion!

- Fixed GUI-related NPE. Thanks, @JMCY26, for the bug report!
- Fixed being able to access "/bigdoors menu" even if you didn't have permission to access the menu. Thanks, @AntiMaid, for the report!
- Permissions are no longer enabled by default. Opt-out permissions are simply too confusing and annoying.
- The config will no longer ignore and remove non-solid blocks from its white/blacklists (powerblocks can only be solid blocks still). This is needed because some non-solid blocks can be animated these days. Thanks, @NiGHTS, for the bug report!
- Updated bStats.

Alpha 0.1.8.21
- Fixed concurrency issue where a door could be toggled more than once under specific circumstances.
- Fixed drawbridges not respecting the defined OpenDirection value. Thanks, @Death By, for the bug report!

Alpha 0.1.8.16
- Updated to the latest version of XMaterial, which is supposed to bring some performance improvements in the areas concerning materials.
- Added beehive and bee nest to the material blacklist.

- Added support for "Lands" (the land claim plugin). Thanks, @serhanekmekci for the request and @angeschossen for generously providing access to their plugin!
- Using negative speed values now results in an instant toggle (so no animations). Example: "/ToggleDoor 42 -1.0" to instantly toggle a door with ID 42. Thanks, @Keifranien for the suggestion!
- Updated the resource pack for version 1.15 of Minecraft. Additionally, the config now uses a boolean value instead of a URL. Thanks, @wjtonline for the report!
- Added BELL to the material blacklist by default to avoid duplication. Thanks, @Achaius for the report!
- Added whitelist option to the config to override the hardcoded blacklist (as well as the blacklist config option). Also sped up material blacklist checking a bit.

Alpha 0.1.8.15
- Added "/shadowtoggledoor <doorName/doorUID>" (permission: bigdoors.admin.shadowtoggledoor) command to toggle a door purely in the database (no blocks will be moved). This can be used to fix a desync issue. It should only be used as a last resort!
- Added support for 1.15.

Alpha 0.1.8.14
- Fixed materials in 1.12. Thanks, @GameFire99 for the bug report!
- Updated to JCalculator 1.6 (for the price formulas in the config), fixing issues with exponentiation and adding some more operators.

Alpha 0.1.8.13
- Added support for Towny. Thanks, @Onions for the suggestion!

- When a door exceeds either the personal door size limit of the owner or player that activated the door, or the global limit, it cannot be toggled anymore. (it used to only skip the animiation).
- Removed the "bigdoors.admin.ignoreownership" permission node. This is replaced by the new node: "bigdoors.admin.bypass.<attribute>". The attributes are: "lock", "toggle", "info", "delete", "relocatepowerblock", "changetime", "blockstomove", "direction", "addowner", and "removeowner".
- Fixed error thrown by TimedCache. Thanks, @Sneaky_42 for the bug report!
- Added material blacklist to the config.
- Fixed GUI buttons in 1.11. Thanks, @HakanUnsalP for the bug report!

Alpha 0.1.8.12
- Fixed sounds being played asynchronously, which Spigot didn't like. Thanks, @DeathReminds for the bug report!

Alpha 0.1.8.11
- Fixed InsufficientFunds message appearing even if the price is just 0. Thanks, @0fficerMike for the bug report!
- Added project URL to update available message received on login. Thanks, @Panda_Nesthesia for the suggestion.
- Fixed "/DoorInfo <doorName>" only working if you provided a doorUID.
- Fixed doors potentially getting corrupted when toggling power blocks in rapid succession, specifically at medium TPS. Thanks, @Ashh for the bug report and being so patient!

- Fixed lack of error message when trying to open a door you do not own via command if the invalid door was the first argument.
- Read-only status of the config file is now respected. It will just show an obnoxious warning message now. Thanks, @bbayu for the bug report!
- Instead of faceplanting when an error occurs while writing the config file, it'll now give a clear error message so I can resolve the issue. Thanks, @bbayu for the bug report!
- Fixed issue with LuckPerms. Thanks, @Relaxing, and others for the bug reports!
- Fixed CAVE_AIR (???) not being treated like regular air, meaning it could prevent doors from opening. Thanks, @ChurchT for the bug report!

- Updated XMaterial. Fixes issues with stained clay in <= 1.12. Thanks, @PaulBan for the bug report!
- Fixed issue with JCalculator. Thanks, @bbayu, and @Netrick for your bug reports.
- OPs and players with the "bigdoors.admin.ignoreownership" permission node can now access all doors via commands, even if they don't own them.
- Cleaned up the formatting of the default translation file a bit.
- Fixed minor memory leak when players disconnect with their BigDoors menu still open.
- Using new update checker. Dev builds now force enable update checking + updating, so people don't linger on them after they've been released.
- Added "/BigDoors upgradedatabaseforv2" command that will prepare the database for v2 of BigDoors. Note that there is no way back, so DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND!!
- In further preparation of v2 of BigDoors, the naive opening system has been deprecated.
  What this means, is that whenever a door that does not have an explicitly defined openDirection (default), they will set the open direction they find when they are first toggled.
  The old system where you could determine the direction a door would go by blocking the other directions will therefore ONLY work the first time you open a door.
  After that it will ALWAYS go in that direction unless you change it via the GUI / Commands.
- Removed NONE open direction option from the GUI + commands.
- Updated database to v6.
- Removed "bigdoors.user.createdoor" permission node. It was redundant (you need "bigdoors.user.createdoor.<type>" anyway). Thanks to everyone who pointed this out!

- 1 wide drawbridges are now allowed, but only if created when flat!

Alpha 0.1.8.7
- Fixed missing openDirection option for the portcullis type. Thanks, @RetroCh1cken for the bug report!
- Fixed autoCloseTimers potentially overlapping. Thanks, @RetroCh1cken for the bug report!
- Selection tool is removed from player's inventory if they log out before finishing or timing out any process involving a selection tool.
- Selection tool cannot be moved into chests etc anymore.

- Removed 1 block depth restriction from portcullises.
- Added support for 1.14's new blocks.
- Added missing multipliers for the new door types to the config. Thanks, @kristinr96 for the report!

Alpha 0.1.8.5
- Added permission node "bigdoors.admin.bypasscompat" to bypass compatibility stuff like WorldGuard and PlotSquared (door creation and toggling).
- OPs also bypass compatibility stuff.
- When a compatibility hook doesn't allow you to create a door somewhere, you'll now be notified which specific hook is blocking access.

Alpha 0.1.8.4

Alpha 0.1.8
- Added "/BigDoors restart" to reload the config and the translation file and generally reinitialize everything.

- DB upgraded to v5.
- Added config option (default = true) to create a backup of the database before performing an upgrade. I hope it'll never be necessary, but if it is, it'll be there!
- Added door ownership tiers. Level 0 = owner, level 1 = admin (full access), level 2 = user (can use door, but not edit it).
- Added "/BigDoors addOwner <doorUID || doorName> <Player || PlayerUUID> [permission level (int)]" and corresponding removeOwner commands to share ownership of a door.
- Added addOwner and removeOwner buttons to GUI.
- Made en_US.txt (default locale file) read-only to make it a bit more clear that you should not edit it (as changes are overwritten).
- Rewrote all GUI code to make my life easier and this plugin a little faster.
- Added option to sort doors in GUI alphabetically (name) or numerically (ID).
- Now storing player names in db (easier and faster).
