# BigDoors v1
BigDoors is a plugin for the Minecraft server mod [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org). Its aim is to enhance your server with
animated blocks that can be used to create, amongst other things, big (animated) doors.

This is the repository for v1 of the BigDoors plugin for SpigotMC. A new version named AnimatedArchitecture is in development [here](https://github.com/PimvanderLoos/AnimatedArchitecture).

If you have a problem with this plugin, please create an issue or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/5ykb943).

This plugin is available for download on the [Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/58669/).

# Get the latest dev-build:
Download the latest dev-build [here](https://pim16aap2.nl/BigDoors/). If you decide to use it, there are a few things you'll have to keep in mind:

* Dev builds will automatically update to the latest stable release as soon as it's available regardless of your settings.
* The dev-builds get updated rather frequently, so check back often (URL stays the same, though).
* These builds might not be tested as thoroughly as the release builds.
* Dev builds may not always be backward compatible with the latest release build. This can occur if the database schema is changed in a dev-build for example (then the old version can no longer read the data). So be sure to make backups!

An updated changelog list can be found [here](https://github.com/PimvanderLoos/BigDoors/blob/master/changelog.txt).

# Add-ons
* [Big Doors Opener](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/80805/) (Created by Eldoria). It allows you to automatically
open doors based on conditions such as player proximity, player permissions, or time of day!
* [Big Doors Physics](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bigdoorsphysics) (Created by bonn2). It adds collisions to the animated blocks!


# FAQ:
* **Will you add support for version 1.8 of Minecraft?**  
  *- No. Update your server!*
* **How can I control doors from the console/command blocks?**  
  *- When issuing commands from the console/command blocks, you cannot use the door name. Instead, you'll have to use doorUIDs.*

# Resource pack:
The plugin comes with an <ins>**optional**</ins> resource pack that only contains sounds that are played during the
animation of the doors. It is not used for the animations themselves.

If you don't want to use the resource pack, you can disable it in the config. Look for the `resourcePackEnabled` option.
You should always disable it if you already have a resource pack installed on your server, as it may otherwise override
your existing pack or cause other issues. Because the resource pack only contains sounds, disabling it only means that
the sounds will not be played. Everything else will still work as intended.

The config also has a list of URLs to the resource packs there for each supported version of Minecraft. You can use
these to download the resource pack manually if you want to either host it yourself or merge it with your existing pack.

Note that translations created for older versions may still work. If there are any missing messages you'll be notified in the log.


# Unsupported Environments:
If the plugin detects that it is in an unsupported environment during startup, it will abort its initialization to prevent issues. You can force the plugin to enable anyway by enabling unsafe mode in the config, but doing so is not supported!!
The following servers are considered unsupported:
* CatServer
* Mohist
* Magma
* Glowstone
* Akarin

And using the following plugins together with BigDoors is also unsupported:
* GeyserMC
* ViaRewind

# Known Issues:
* Because every block in a door is transformed into an entity, larger doors can be taxing on the client.
* Due to their nature, anti-lag plugins tend to remove the entities used by this plugin. This will result in blocks temporarily disappearing and appearing at their opened position after a slight delay. To prevent this, add entities of type "FallingBlock" named "BigDoorsEntity" to their whitelist.


# Commands and Permissions:
*When opening doors from the console/command block, NAMES DO NOT WORK! 
You need to use DoorUIDs there. 
Why? Because names are not unique, while DoorUIDs are. 
This constraint means that your command blocks won't break when someone 
creates a new door with the same name as the one you used.*

The permissions are set up such that `bigdoors.user.*` will give a user access to all
actions that a user should generally be allowed to do. 
Any admin-specific access is locked behind `bigdoors.admin.*`. 
This should provide a good starting point with setting up the plugin.

In all the following commands, any parameter between angled brackets is required (i.e. `<RequiredArgument>`) and
parameters between square brackets are optional (i.e. `[OptionalParameter]`).

Whenever the instructions refer to a `DoorID`, 
this means that you can use either the door's name or its (numerical) UID.

## Thanks

As a final note, I'd like to thank [Captain_Chaos](https://dev.bukkit.org/members/captain_chaos) for making his [PorteCoulissante](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/portecoulissante) plugin. I've used it a lot and it inspired me to make this plugin!
